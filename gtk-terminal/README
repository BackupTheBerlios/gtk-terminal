This project illustrates building the simplest GTK application. In order to use
it copy the entire directory to the new location, say ~/Projects/hello. Then create
the necessary infrastructure by executing the following:

$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ touch stamp-h
$ autoconf
$ automake -a -c
$ ./configure

Once you have done this check if the program compiles and can be run:

$ make
$ src/shasha

If it did, you have successfully created a skeleton GTK application. Feel free
to modify the src directory (and any other, but start with src), by adding new
functionality to the application.
